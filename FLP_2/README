Description
===============
The application can solve randomly shuffled Rubik's Cube. The input is the description of shuffled cube, 
the output is the sequence of moves leading to the solution. These moves contain a description of the cube 
after each step of the solution (the individual steps are separated by an empty line). 
The application searches the state space using the Iterative Deepening Search (IDS) algorithm 
and tries to solve the cube using algorithms containing from 0 to 20 moves. Possible moves are 
clockwise or counterclockwise moves (9 possibilities), rotations (3 possibilities) and double moves and rotations. 
If a solution is found, application prints output and ends.  

Usage
===============
The compilation of application:
make      - builds the application 
make pack - creates the ZIP archive containing all project files

The application can be run using:
./flp18-log < input
- input - application reads the description of the shuffled cube in a specific format from file or stdin
  
Testing
===============
The testing set contains five inputs with the description of shuffled cube. File test5.in was launched only once due to long computation time. 
Nevertheless, the exact computation time was not found because of the Merlin connection failure (after one hour of the running programme).
Other files were launched 10 times and then average computation time was calculated. Tests were performed on server Merlin.
The results show, the computation time grows rapidly when the solution of the cube requires more than 5 moves. 

File test1.in: 
- number of moves: 2
- average computation time [s]: 0.013

File test2.in: 
- number of moves: 3
- average computation time [s]: 0.225

File test3.in: 
- number of moves: 4
- average computation time [s]: 1.218

File test4.in: 
- number of moves: 5
- computation time [s]: 321.337

File test5.in:
- number of moves: 6
- compilation time [s]: > 3600
